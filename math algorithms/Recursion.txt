What is Recursion?
Recursion is when a function calls itself.
Recursion is a problem solving technique where the solution of a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of that same problem.

Why do we need Recursion?
Recursion is used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller instances of the same problem. 
A great technique to simplyfy your solution.

#A few points about Recursion
-Every recursive solution need to have a base case (a condition to terminate the recursion).
-Recursion might simplyfy solving the same problem but it does not always translate to  a faster solution. A recursive solution may be far worse compared  to an intractive solution .
-Recursion is a topic that is not easy to understand. do not give up if you struggle with the concept.
