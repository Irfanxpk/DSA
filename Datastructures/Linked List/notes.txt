A linkedlist is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes. 
Each node consist of data value and a pointer that points to the next node.
The list element can be easly inserted or removed without reallocation or reorganization of the entire structure.
Random access of elements is not feasable and accessing an element has linear time complexity
the linked list data structure support three main operations
1. Insertion - to add an element at the bigging, end or at a given index in the list .
2. Deletion- remove an item given its index or value
3. Search  - Search to find an element
